<h1>Glaser family and the civil war</h1>
Source: Sheila Glaser Bultmann's paper
<p><a href="http://www.newribbon.com/family/person.asp?personID=697">Gertrude Simon Glaser</a> had been widowed for 8 years when she came to America in 1837, with her two grown sons, <a href="http://www.newribbon.com/family/person.asp?personID=702">John (Johann)</a> and <a href="http://www.newribbon.com/family/person.asp?personID=269">Franz</a> and their families.  
They had just sold their farm and belongings (considerable property) in Eiweiler and came to settle in Sheldon.  
A third son, <a href="http://www.newribbon.com/family/person.asp?personID=700">Peter</a>, Emigrated at a later time and also settled in Sheldon.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.newribbon.com/family/family.asp?familyid=80">Franz Glaser and Anna Marie Becker</a> had married 15 years earlier in the church in Mettnich; Eiweiler belonged at that time to the Catholic parish in Mettnich.  
They emigrated with seven Eiweiler-born children and later, six more children were born in America - 13 children!  Franz farmed in Sheldon until his death in 1862.  </p>

<p>At that time the country was torn by the Civil War (1861-1865) in which nearly half a million American soldiers lost their lives, more than in the second World War!  
The three youngest, American-born sons had followed Lincoln's call to volunteer.  <a href="http://www.newribbon.com/family/person.asp?personID=811">Frank</a>, the oldest of the three at first seemed to have enjoyed the adventure and he wrote to his older brother, Peter: </p>

<p><cite>
"...our reg't was very luchey so far it has not been in to a Battle yet except the other Day we drove the rebiles out of Harper's ferry we had fine times in Baltimore and could wish for no better times for a soldering we got acquainted with a great many peopals there but Now I think that we got to make up all our good times we had there..." </cite></p>

<p>
Soon after, in 1863, he saw his two younger brothers, <a href="http://www.newribbon.com/family/person.asp?personID=812">Jacob</a> (19) and <a href="http://www.newribbon.com/family/person.asp?personID=813">Mathias</a> (16) killed by snipers on the way to the battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  He had to step over their bodies and could only return after the battle to bury them under a tree.  
His mother died 3 months later.  He himself got a bullet wound in the leg and had to be hospitalized for a long time.  
He got home just in time to reclaim his fiance, who was about to get married to someone else.  </p>
