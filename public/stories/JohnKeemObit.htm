<h1>John Keem Obituary</h1>

<h2>1929</h2>

<p>John Keem, a well known and nearly life long resident of Wales, died at his home in that town on Wednesday, January 30, after a lingering illness at the age of 84 years.  </p>
<p>He was born the fourth son of <a href="http://www.newribbon.com/family/family.asp?familyid=76">Mr. and Mrs. Martin Keem</a>, who came to America from Alsace in the year 1924.  After working on the Erie canal where he sustained a fractured leg, he came to Willink (now Aurora) and worked for the elder Hamlin, C. J. Hamlin's father, and came to Sheldon in 1836 and was employed as foreman to manage the large holdings of the late Dr. Cyrus Hamilton for a period of four years.  He then went to farming for himself and soon bought a farm in Wales which became known as the Keem homestead and which the deceased, John, still owned at the time of his death. </p>
