The Keem/Reisdorf side:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="{{ action('FamilyController@show', [76]) }}">Martin & Catherine Keem</a> (5 generations back) were both born in <b>Alsace (Gunstett and Schaenenburg, respectively)</b>, and
                they were married and came to the US together <b>around 1830</b>. They had a son named
                <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [51]) }}">Nicholas</a>. </li>

            <li>Mary Glaser came this this country from <b>Germany</b> with
                <a href="{{ action('FamilyController@show', [80]) }}">her parents</a> in <b>1838</b> at the age of 8.
                Around the age of 17, she married
                <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [250]) }}">Peter Reisdorf</a>, who was born in <b>Rheinland, Prussia</b> and came to the states sometime <b>between 1824 and 1845</b>.
                Mary & Peter Reisdorf (5 generations back)
                had a daughter named <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [50]) }}">Catherine.</a>

                We can actually go way back on Mary's side, back into a set of her paternal great great great grandparents:  <a href="{{ action('FamilyController@show', [218]) }}">Mathias & Maria  Zohler</a>,
                in Germany in the <b>1600's</b>.

                Another note:  Mary Glaser's family may have already been in the US generations before! Her great-great grandmother was Maria Kuhn,
                and based on other matching trees on ancestry.com, Maria's parents, grandparents, and all 4 sets of great-grandparents had come to the
                US together in the early 1700's.
                They stayed for 3 generations but Maria Kuhn was born in Germany (though her parents lived and died in the US)- this data needs to be verified.</li>

            <li>Connection: Catherine Reisdorf married Nicholas Keem. Nicholas and Catherine Keem had a son named
                <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [52]) }}">Albert</a>, who was <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [62]) }}">Kay</a>'s father. </li>

        </ul>

            <li><a href="{{ action('FamilyController@show', [104]) }}">Stephen & Anna Maria Schmeid</a> came to this country (6 generations back- Stephen from <b>Luxembourg</b>, Anna Maria unknown).
