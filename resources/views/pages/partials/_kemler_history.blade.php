The Kemler side:
        <ul>
            <li>Gert's father <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [18]) }}">Louis Kemler</a> (3 generations back) came to the US
                from <b>Kiev, Ukraine</b> (still part of the Russian empire at the time) with his father
                <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [17]) }}">Solomon</a> <b>around 1902</b>- he was
                13 years old. They left Russia together, Solomon left Louis in England for about 2 years (living in a small room in
                the back of a bakery), and Solomon came to NYC by himself to earn money to bring his family to America.
                <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [16]) }}">Ida</a>  stayed in Russia <img src="/flags/ru.gif" />
                with at least one other child (most likely both Rose and Joseph) until Solomon could send for them.
                Louis left England from Liverpool and came to NYC as a stowaway on a ship, and the others joined within a few years 1904 and 1908
                (Charlie was born in Russia around 1904, and Molly was born in Massachusetts in 1908).
