<h3>Who is in the families list?  </h3>
</div>

<br/>

<p>
   I've researched the families of my 4 grandparents, and connected with a lot of relatives far and wide.  This family tree spans 14 generations,
    more than 650 people, and 175 families!

    Folks visiting this site are often only related to only one or two, so I try to just show you the ones you're connected with.  It works like this:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Generations are represented by color (see the color key beneath the families list), and my great-grandparents are in red.  </li>
    <li> For generations earlier than that, I only list direct lines back (their parents, grandparents, etc)
        and you can navigate to siblings' families from there.</li>
    <li>   For later generations I display all of the descendents' families. </li>
