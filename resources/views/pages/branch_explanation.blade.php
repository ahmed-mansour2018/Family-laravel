<h3>Who is in the families list?  </h3>
</div>

<br/>

<p>
   I've collected a bunch of info going back and forward from my 4 grandparents, and I've connected with a lot of relatives far and wide.
    The data is  pretty vast (spanning 14 generations, more than 800 people, and 250 families). Not everything's
    relevant to everyone visiting the site depending on how you're related, so on the different views I try to just show you the folks
    you're connected with.</p>


    The family list is filtered that way too, and also we've got:


<ul>
<li>Generations represented by color (see the color key beneath the families list); my great-grandparents are in red, and the later
    descendents' families are all displayed underneath.  </li>
    <li> For generations earlier than that, I only list direct lines back (their parents/grandparents/etc) and not siblings' families,
        but from those family pages you can click siblings to get to their family info. </li>
