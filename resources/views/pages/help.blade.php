        Our Family Tree : Help
    </h3>


    <h4>What can I do here? </h4>

<ul>
    <li>Start with the Home link to explore your family history, album, and more. </li>
    <li>Check out your page and fill in what's missing- everyone's updates go a long way. </li>
    <li>Share memories onto your relatives' pages, and send me pictures to add so everyone can be included</li>
    <li>From a person or family page, you can travel up and down through generations using the navigation arrows & person links.</li>
    <li>To jump to someone specific, use the navbar links: Families, People, or "Me!"</li>
    <li>'My Account' shows you your activity and lets you reset your password.   </li>
</ul>

    <h4>I know other relatives who'd like this- how can they log in? </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Send them <a href="register">this link</a> so they can request an account  </li>
        </ul>

<h4>Need help? </h4>

    <ul>
    <li>If you find a mistake or have any information/pictures to add, click the "Update this page" link on
        the page, or <a href="mailto:dianekaplan@gmail.com">email me</a> and
        I'll make the update <br/></li>

        <li>If you come across an error message, please <A HREF="mailto:dianekaplan@gmail.com">let me know</A> so I can fix it- thank you! <br/></li>

    </ul>

    <h4>What's  next? </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Home movies!  I'm having some old footage digitized, if you have some to add, let me know. </li>
        <li>Choronological outline view (like the old family tree had) </li>
        <li>Being able to add pictures directly (instead of emailing to me) </li>
        <li>Other ideas? <a href="mailto:dianekaplan@gmail.com">Let me know</a> what you'd like to see.
    </ul>
