        Our Family Tree : FAQs
    </h3>


    <h4>What can I do here? </h4>

<ul>
    <li>Start with the Home link to explore your family history, album, and more. </li>
    <li>Check out your page and fill in what's missing- everyone's updates go a long way. </li>
    <li>Share memories onto your relatives' pages, and send me pictures to add so everyone can be included</li>
    <li>From a person or family page, you can travel up and down through generations using the navigation arrows & person links.</li>
    <li>To jump to someone specific, use the navbar links: Families, People, or "Me!"</li>
    <li><b>Be sure to change your password on 'My Account' </b>(and you can see your activity there too).   </li>
</ul>

    <h4>I know other relatives who'd like this- how can they log in? </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Send them <a href="register">this link</a> so they can request an account.  For all of our protection, <b>do not
                share your login with anyone else. </b>  </li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Who can see this family tree? </h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Family info is extremely sensitive, so it's a fundamental concern with any family tree.
            The public websites handle it by having everything private/hidden for people still alive unless you explicitly
            grant permission to share your tree with somebody.  Similarly for the site I'm making, this is only explicitly shared
            with known people.  The only people able to see any info are known family members who are on the tree already. </li>

        <li> Further, each account is created based on how that person is related, so you're only shown people from the side of the family
            we have in common.  That way what you see is more relevant, and also it doesn't cast the net any wider than needed.</li>

            <li>Then once the website is live (for now I'm still building) the only part anyone could potentially find in a search
            engine will be the <a href="landing">login page</a>. That page does have names and thumbnails on it, so that a potential
            relative researching an ancestor will be able to find it and connect.  On the old version of this site that only
            happened a couple times (since geneology is a pretty narrow interest). When that does happen, I make the person answer
                some questions about our ancestors to prove they're really 'them' (since we haven't met).  Obviously this wouldn't be
                bulletproof if a potential identity thief took the time to research our ancestors somehow, but it is unlikely.
        </li>

    </ul>
