        Our Family Tree : FAQs
    </h3>


    <h4>What can I do here? </h4>

<ul>
    <li>The 'Home' link presents a few ways to explore our family history, album, videos, and more. </li>
    <li>Check your page (linked on the homepage and picture in the top nav) and fill in what's missing- everyone's updates go a long way </li>
    <li>From a person or family page, travel up and down through generations using the navigation arrows & person links.</li>
    <li>Share memories onto your relatives' pages, and send any pictures you'd like added</li>
    <li>To go to someone specific, use the navbar links for indexes: Families, People</li>
    <li><b>Be sure to change your password on 'My Account' </b>(and you can see your activity there too).   </li>
</ul>

    <h4>I know other relatives who'd like this- how can they log in? </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Send them <a href="register">this link</a> so they can request an account.  For all of our protection, <b>do not
                share your login with anyone else. </b>  </li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Who can see this family tree? </h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Family info is (of course) extremely sensitive, so privacy is a fundamental concern.
            The public ancestry websites handle it by hiding info for people who are still alive, unless you explicitly
            grant permission to share your tree with each other.  Similarly here, the only people able to see any
            info are known family members who are on the tree themselves, where I've explicitly created an account for that person.
        </li>

        <li> Each account is created based on how that person is related, so you're only shown people from the side of the family
            we have in common.  That way you only see what's relevant, and the net isn't cast any wider than needed.</li>

            <li>The only info visible without a login (if this site is returned by a search engine) is the <a href="landing">login page</a>.
                Names and thumbnail images appear there, so a potential relative researching an ancestor can find it and contact
                me. (This happens less than once a year, since geneology is a pretty narrow interest). When
                that happens, I make the person answer some questions about our ancestors to prove they're 'them'
                (since we haven't met).  This isn't bulletproof if a potential identity thief took the time to research
                our family ancestors, but it's a much higher barrier to fraud than a public website such as Facebook.
        </li>
