        Our Family Tree : Help
    </h3>


    <h3>What can I do on the site? </h3>
<ul><b>A lot!</b>
    <li>First, check out your page and fill in what's missing- everyone's updates go a long way. </li>
    <li>Click Home in the navbar to see explore your family history, album, and more. </li>
    <li>Once you're on a person or family page, you can travel up and down through generations using the navigation arrows & person links.
         </li>
    <li>To jump to someone specific, use the navbar links: Families, People, or "Me!"</li>
    <li>This family tree is about a lot more than names and dates; write  memories onto your relatives' pages, and send me pictures to add! </li>
    <li>'My Account' shows you your activity and lets you reset your password.   </li>
    <li>Use the footer link to spread the word to any relatives who'd be interested in having a look (so they know where to request a login).  </li>
</ul>

    <li><b>Sometimes I need to give my password and sometimes I don't- why is that? </b>  When you log in, your computer saves your
        password for 5 days (so when you return the next day you can do directly in to your home page).
        If you don't want the password saved, just click the "Log Out" link when you're done and it'll be cleared out.
        Then you'll be automatically prompted for your password the next time you come to the site. <br/></li>

    <li><b>I see an error!</b>  Please <A HREF="mailto:dianekaplan@gmail.com">let me know</A> so I can fix it- thank you! <br/></li>

    <li><b>I see a mistake in the info here, what do I do?</b>  I appreciate all the help I can get-
        if you find a mistake or have any information/pictures to add,  click the "Update this page" link on
        the page, or if it's a page without this link, <a href="mailto:dianekaplan@gmail.com">let me know</a> and
        I'll make the update <br/></li>

</ul>


    <h3>What's coming next? </h3>
    <ul><b>Some improvements on the horizon:</b>
        <li>Being able to add pictures directly (instead of emailing to me) </li>
        <li>Being able to add notes to families (not just people). </li>
        <li>Being able to add new people/families (instead of emailing to me) </li>

        <li>Other ideas? <a href="mailto:dianekaplan@gmail.com">Let me know</a> what you'd like to see.
